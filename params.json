It also gives a\r\ncentral place to find all your systems' current data. By using the ArnBrowser, all data\r\nobjects are real time presented in a tree view.\r\n\r\n---\r\n[ArnLib Wiki](https://github.com/micwik/ArnLib/wiki)  \r\n[ArnLib Doxygen](doxy_html/index.html) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ArnLib PDF](ArnLib_doxy.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Comparison to similar concepts\r\n\r\n* **Data mart:** Statistical data gathered from different systems. This makes it possible\r\nto run cross system analysis.\r\n\r\n* **Windows Registry & AD:** Centralized configuration data. All in one place easily shared.\r\n\r\n* **ArnLib:** Hot changing data from different systems. Enables easy cross system data\r\nexchange, debugging, etc.\r\n<Br><Br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\nOne example of professional use is in fire-fighting vehicles. This application has run for some years in 80 vehicles. Most of the hundreds of sensors and controls in the vehicle, are present in an Arn Registry. A graphical user interface is used for monitoring and control during a fire mission.\r\n\r\n![alt text](http://www.martinsson.se/App_Data/Cache/Thumbs/4/5/45b8e587-8769-4fe7-bcad-a10800f6d699-460x0.jpg \"Example fire figher vehicle\")\r\n\r\n[Follow link to: Panel controlling fire fighter vehicle](http://www.martinsson.se/autokaross)\r\n\r\nArnLib has proven to be very efficient and stable to work with. The originator's home automation system has now run reliable for many years with ArnLib.\r\n\r\nArnLib could be beneficial in a lot of projects.\r\nIt should be well suited to the following conditions:\r\n\r\n* _A lot of configurations and changing values._  <Br>\r\nArnLib helps giving out-of-the-box diagnostics and ability to change values not yet\r\navailable in the custom application user interface.\r\n\r\n* _Hardware with a lot of sensors and controls._  <Br>\r\nArnlib helps giving a common interface and diagnostic.\r\n\r\n* _Distributed systems._  <Br>\r\nArnLib helps giving an out-of-the-box data sharing system that replicates Arn objects.\r\n\r\n* _Networked services by RPC (remote procedure call)._  <Br>\r\nWill be quite the same as setting up signals and slots for local calls. You can find an\r\neasy example in the ArnLib package, showing a simple chat Client and Server.\r\n\r\n* _ZeroConfig detection of present services._ <Br>\r\nHelps advertise and browse a service (ftp, http, arn, ...) on a local network.\r\nThis is similar to UPNP discovery of units.\r\n<Br><Br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\n* Based on Qt 4 & 5, multiple platform and OS support.\r\n* Qt based Arn browser available. Allows you to access all data objects in a tree view (see [ArnBrowser](https://github.com/micwik/ArnBrowser/wiki/example-gallery)).\r\n* Web based Arn browser available, allowing you to use a standard web browser (see [WebArnBrowser](https://github.com/micwik/WebArnBrowser/wiki/example-gallery)).\r\n\r\n#### Arn Data Objects\r\n\r\n* Hierarchical storage of hot changing data objects.\r\n\r\n* _Arn Data objects_ can be: integers, floats, strings, byte arrays and variants\r\n(most Qt data types, e.g. QImage).\r\n\r\n* Data objects can typically be: measures, settings, datastreams, documents, scripts (js), etc.\r\n\r\n* _Arn Data objects_ are thread-safe.\r\n\r\n* Native support for data validation and double direction pipes (streams).\r\n\r\n#### Sharing\r\n\r\n* Data objects can be shared in a single program, among threads or between programs, at\r\ndifferent computers. This division of program modules can be changed and is transparent\r\nto usage of ArnLib.\r\n\r\n* Support for temporary session data objects.\r\nOptional auto-delete of objects when tcp/ip closes and unique uuid names.\r\n\r\n* Dependency system with custom offered services and getting signals when all needed services\r\nare available.\r\n\r\n* Monitoring of newly created data objects and any mode change.\r\n\r\n#### Persistent storage\r\n\r\n* Optional persistent storage of object in SQLight or in a file.\r\n\r\n* Support for version control (VCS) of objects stored in files.\r\n\r\n#### Java Script\r\n\r\n* Native support in JavaScript for: _Arn Data Objects_, Dependency system and\r\nMonitoring of changed objects.\r\n\r\n* Java Script jobstack with preemptive and cooperative scripts running at different priorities.\r\n\r\n* Hot swap of changed Java Script in jobstack.\r\n\r\n#### Data streams and _Remote Procedure Call_\r\n\r\n* All data streams (pipes) can easily be monitored and manual test data can be inserted\r\n(see ArnBrowser).\r\n\r\n* Service Api, for calling routines anywhere in connected Arn.\r\n_Remote Procedure call_ (RPC) simple to use as \"remote signal slots\".\r\n\r\n* Service Api has an automatically generated help for giving syntax when doing debug manual\r\ntyped calls to a RPC service.\r\n\r\n#### ZeroConfig and Discover\r\n\r\n* Any service (ftp, http, arn, etc) can be advertised, browsed and resolved for its host\r\n  address and port number.\r\n\r\n* High level, fully automatic support specialised for _arn_ service, can e.g. remotely\r\n  change the advertised _service name_.\r\n\r\n* Simple integration together with a custom GUI for browsing, etc.\r\n\r\n* Optional internal DNS_SD/mDNS routines for no dependency to any extra library.\r\n\r\n---\r\n![alt text](https://github.com/micwik/WebArnBrowser/wiki/images/WebArnBrowser_1.png \"Web ArnBrowser\")\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
