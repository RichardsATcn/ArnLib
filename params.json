It also gives a\r\ncentral place to find all your systems current data. By using the ArnBrowser, all data\r\nobjects are real time presented in a tree view.\r\n\r\n---\r\n[ArnLib Wiki](https://github.com/micwik/ArnLib/wiki)  \r\n[ArnLib Doxygen](doxy_html/index.html) &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; [ArnLib PDF](ArnLib_doxy.pdf)\r\n\r\n### Comparison to similar concepts\r\n\r\n* **Data mart:** Statistical data gathered from different systems. This makes it possible\r\nto run cross system analysis.\r\n\r\n* **Windows Registry:** Centralized configuration data. All in one place easily shared.\r\n\r\n* **ArnLib:** Hot changing data from different systems. Enables easy cross system data\r\nexchange, debugging, etc.\r\n<Br><Br>\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\n* Based on QT, multiple platform and OS support.\r\n\r\n#### Arn Data Objects\r\n\r\n* Hierarchical storage of \"hot\" changing data objects.\r\n\r\n* _Arn Data objects_ can be: integers, floats, strings, byte arrays and variants\r\n(most QT data types, e.g. QImage).\r\n\r\n* Data objects can typically be: measures, settings, datastreams, documents, scripts (js), ...\r\n\r\n* _Arn Data objects_ are thread-safe.\r\n\r\n* Native support for data validation and double direction pipes.\r\n\r\n#### Sharing\r\n\r\n* Data objects can be shared in a single program, among threads or between programs at\r\ndifferent computers. This division of program modules can be changed and are transparent\r\nto usage of ArnLib.\r\n\r\n* Support for temporary session data objects.\r\nOptional auto-delete of objects when tcp/ip closes and unique uuid names.\r\n\r\n* Dependency system with custom offered services and getting signals when all needed services\r\nare available.\r\n\r\n* Monitoring of newly created data objects and any mode change.\r\n\r\n#### Persistent storage\r\n\r\n* Optional persistent storage of object in SQLight or in a file.\r\n\r\n* Support for version control (VCS) of objects stored in files.\r\n\r\n#### Java Script\r\n\r\n* Native support in JavaScript for: _Arn Data Objects_, Dependency system and\r\nMonitoring of changed objects.\r\n\r\n* Java Script jobstack with preemptive and cooperative scripts running at different priorities.\r\n\r\n* Hot swap of changed Java Script in jobstack.\r\n\r\n#### Data streams and _Remote Procedure Call_\r\n\r\n* All data streams (pipes) can easily be monitored and manual test data can be inserted\r\n(see ArnBrowser).\r\n\r\n* Service Api, for calling routines anywhere in connected Arn.\r\n_Remote Procedure call_ (RPC) made simple as \"remote signal slots\".\r\n\r\n* Service Api has an automatically generated help for giving syntax when doing debug manual\r\ntyped calls to a RPC service.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
