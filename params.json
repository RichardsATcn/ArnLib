It also gives a central place to find all your systems current data. By using the ArnBrowser, all data objects are real time presented in a tree view.\r\n\r\n---\r\n[ArnLib Wiki](https://github.com/micwik/ArnLib/wiki)  \r\n[ArnLib Doxygen](doxy_html/index.html)\r\n\r\n### Comparison to similar concepts\r\n\r\n* **Data mart:** Statistical data gathered from different systems. This makes it possible to run cross system analysis.\r\n\r\n* **Windows Registry:** Centralized configuration data. All in one place easily shared.\r\n\r\n* **ArnLib:** Hot changing data from different systems. Enables easy cross system data exchange, debugging etc.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Main features\r\n\r\nskdlöksdlökslöd\r\n\r\n### Main features\r\n\r\nsldlsödlösldölsdö\r\n\r\n#### Main features\r\n\r\n* Based on QT, multiple plattform and OS support.\r\n\r\n* Hierchical storage of \"hot\" changing data objects.\r\n\r\n* Data objects can be: integers, floats, strings, bytearrays and variants (most QT types, ex picture).\r\n\r\n* Data objects can be: measures, settings, datastreams, documents, scripts (js), ...\r\n\r\n* Data objects are thread-safe. \r\n\r\n* Data objects can be shared in a single program, among threads or between programs at different computers.\r\nThis division of program modules can be changed and are transparent to ArnLib.\r\n\r\n* Native support for data validation and double direction pipes.\r\n\r\n* Support for temporary session data objects.\r\nOptional auto-delete of objects when tcp/ip close and unique uuid names.\r\n\r\n* Monitoring of newly created data objects and any mode change.\r\n\r\n* Dependency system with custom offered services and getting signals when all needed is available.\r\n\r\n* Optional persistent storage of object in SQLight or in a file.\r\n\r\n* Support for version control of objects stored in files.\r\n\r\n* Native support for JavaScript, jobstack of JS with preemtive and \r\ncooperative script running.\r\n\r\n* Support for managing changed script restart in jobstack.\r\n\r\n* Service Api, for calling routines anywhere in connected Arn.\r\nRemote procedure call made simple as \"remote signal slots\".\r\n\r\n* All data streams can easily be monitored and manual testdata can be inserted (see ArnBrowser).\r\n\r\n* ...\r\n  To be Continued\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
